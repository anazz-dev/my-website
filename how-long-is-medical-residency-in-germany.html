    		<h2>Germany: Medical Residency Length, Regulating Authorities, and Exams</h2>
    		<p>In Germany, the length of medical residency varies based on the chosen specialty. On average, it takes between 5 to 6 years to complete your medical residency. The <a href="https://www.baek.de/">German Medical Association (Bundesärztekammer)</a> is the regulating authority responsible for overseeing the medical education and training of doctors. During residency, physicians in Germany must pass an oral examination called the "Facharztprüfung" before being recognized as a specialist.</p>
        <h2>England: Medical Residency Length, Regulating Authorities, and Exams</h2>
    		<p>In England, medical residency, known as specialty training, lasts between 3 to 8 years, depending on the specialty. The <a href="https://www.gmc-uk.org/">General Medical Council (GMC)</a> regulates medical education and training in the UK. Throughout the residency, doctors must pass several exams, including the Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians (MRCP) or the Membership of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons (MRCS), depending on their chosen specialty.</p>
    		<h2>USA: Medical Residency Length, Regulating Authorities, and Exams</h2>
    		<p>In the USA, medical residency typically lasts between 3 to 7 years, based on the chosen specialty. The <a href="https://www.acgme.org/">Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)</a> is the regulating authority for residency programs. During residency, physicians are required to pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 3, which is a computer-based examination assessing clinical knowledge and skills.</p>
    		<h2>Canada: Medical Residency Length, Regulating Authorities, and Exams</h2>
    		<p>Canadian medical residency programs usually last between 2 to 5 years, depending on the specialty.

Residents must pass the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE) Part II and the relevant certification exams for their chosen specialty.</p>
    		<h2>Australia: Medical Residency Length, Regulating Authorities, and Exams</h2>
    		<p>In Australia, medical residency, known as vocational training, ranges from 3 to 7 years, based on the specialty. The <a href="https://www.amc.org.au/">Australian Medical Council (AMC)</a> and the <a href="https://www.medicalboard.gov.au/">Medical Board of Australia (MBA)</a> are responsible for regulating medical education and training. During their residency, doctors must pass the appropriate specialty-specific examinations, such as the Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (FRACP) or the Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (FRACS).</p>
